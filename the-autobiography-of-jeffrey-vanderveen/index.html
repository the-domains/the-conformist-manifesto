his autobiography. He ponders over how everyone imagine themselves to be unique
but still end up in the very same place. Connecting the dots, he elaborates how
his life reflects the global “ideal” where he gets a job, goes to work, gets
married, follows fashion, acts like everybody else and pretends he is free. </p><p>He describes his early life in India and his love for the
arts as a child. Vanderveen then talks about how he instantly conforms to the
19<sup>th</sup>-century-factory-model education system and excels in structured
education, at the cost of all things fun.</p><p>Part 2 begins with Vanderveen writing from Dubai, UAE,
receiving letters from his family back in India. They keep telling him that he’s
great and he should continue doing what he was doing, and that he is on the
path to becoming (another) something great; possibly a doctor or a lawyer or an
engineer. In Dubai he discovers his passion for sports and martial arts and
pursues them tirelessly at the cost of his academics.</p><p>The motto of his teen years was “I don’t care what you do as
long as you come first”, His parents favourite quote. He talks about how his parents were extremely
strict about all things educational and how they him to excel down the path
they felt was right for him while contrarily fuelling his desire to be first
and stand out.</p><p>Part 3 picks talks about how Vanderveen decides to become a fully-fledged
conformist and becomes an engineer.He
then goes on to gain a super power he refers to as ‘engineering vision’ which
helps him break down everything in the world and look at things for what they
really are. He gradually grows to love and be content with engineering.</p><p>'Engineering vision’ makes him second guess his chosen
path. It reawakens the artist in him. Yet he continues down this chosen path aimlessly.</p><p>Part 4 picks up eight years later where Vanderveen is at a
huge disconnect with his career and has to make a decision between continuing
down his unfulfilling path or doing what makes him happy. He decides he needs
two things: to create again and start getting paid for it. He talks about the
trail of thought that led him making the first intentional decision about the
future of his life.</p><p>The autobiography ends with VanderVeen trying to unlearn
what he learned in twenty nine years of conforming by writing his first
Creativity and Innovation report.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="44"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="46"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="47"><span data-reactid="48"><!-- react-empty: 49 --><h2 data-reactid="50"><a data-reactid="51">the conformist manifesto</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="54"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="55"></div></section></div></div>
