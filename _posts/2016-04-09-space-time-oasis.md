According to John Cleese a space-time oasis should meet basic needs.

It should give you

1\. Space

A space that disconnects you from your regular life.

2\. Time

to stay in your perfect space

3\. Time

to come up with something original

4\. Confidence

to say what you want without judgement and

5\. Humor

to open up peoples minds.

Every second Friday night, a few of my entrepreneurial friends and I meet up for a few hours to have kebabs and sheesha and discuss anything and everything. Our main topics usually revolve around politics, U.F.C. and what new and business ideas we've thought up over the previous weeks.

Then we go our separate ways and think about our discussions and put the interesting ideas on our idea log.

The relaxed setting and friendly company and beautiful sheesha brings out the best and funniest out of us.

It is my perfect space-time oasis.

Two successful business have come out of our Friday sheesha sessions.

As the sole engineer in my own department, I set my own kpi's and am free to suggest any idea I conceive as long as I can show some return on investment.

Do I have a space-time oasis at work?

No

What do I have?

Space to function and time  to ponder over ideas and indecisions and confidence that come out of the quantitative nature of my job.

What do I need?

Weekly time to spend in my oasis and a few more funny, smart people.
