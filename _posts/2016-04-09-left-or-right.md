Left or Right

An independent and obviously conclusive 12 minute test
online tells me that the two hemispheres of my brain function in perfect
harmony with each other with a slight propensity towards the right side.

Did I already know this information?

Yes of course.

When I was younger I was a being of pure logic. Completely
calculative and emotionally disconnected from every decision I made. But then I
started to visualise my brain as a computing machine it is. 

Feelings are essentially a logical response towards
environmental stimuli. Billions of years of evolution has led to us
subconsciously analysing information collected from all our senses to give us
an almost instinctual response to any situation were presented with in the form
of feelings.

It could be a way of guidance when an answer doesn't easily
present itself. 

Since I came to this realization, I almost never discount my
feelings towards things anymore. I still like to analyse data systematically to
come to logical conclusions. But I don't actually settle on it until I feel
good about the results.

When it comes to processing information, mind maps are the
perfect analogy to how I think.

I use mind maps both physically and mentally to holistically
process linear thought processes and interlink them. I throw random ideas onto these
maps and try to find links so I can sequence them and categorize them on a
deeper level.

I think the ideal way to solve problems of any kind is by
analysing every detail as logically as possible, exposing that information in
the most understanding way and then act on it based on how you feel.

I like both pretty pictures and spreadsheets.

This is accurately reflected in the test score.

But then again, all this left brain / right brain stuff
might have more to do with personality than the actual brain! 

["analyses suggest that an
individual brain is not "left-brained" or "right-brained" as a global property,
but that asymmetric lateralization is a property of individual nodes or local
subnetworks"][0]
