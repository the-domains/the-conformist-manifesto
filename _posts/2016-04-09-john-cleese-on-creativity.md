How many comedians does it take to talk about Creativity?

Apparently none. In his own words, whatever Cleese tells us about how to be more creative is a complete waste of time.

He tells us that it is completely futile for him to quantify something that may not entirely be explicable.

But, people could be more "creative" simply by changing their way of operating.

To be creative all one has to do is practice being creative. 

Create a Space time oasis, visit it occasionally. Learn how to have fun again by being like a child. Children intuitively operative in a creative fashion. Don't fear criticism, nothing is wrong. Understand the difference between being serious and being solemn. Try being seriously funny! Never get stuck in one mode of operation. There is a time and place to be both open and closed. And most importantly **BE PATIENT**. Originality takes time.

Not everything in our lives is interconnected. But intertwining illogical ideas with each other might be the avenue which leads to the next big thing. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/418e04aefbd91376deed82087321ef0eac1bc80b.png)
