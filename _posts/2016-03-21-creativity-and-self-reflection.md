  The

  Creativity and Self-Reflection Worksheet has made me realize that my main

  creative barriers have to do with procrastination and a disorganized process
  to

  creating ideas. Which I'm usually open minded, I usually enter a discussion

  with preconceived thoughts and ideas that prevent me from absorbing new

  information or giving it a chance. This also leads to some people thinking

The
Creativity and Self-Reflection Worksheet has made me realize that my main
creative barriers have to do with procrastination and a disorganized process to
creating ideas. Which I'm usually open minded, I usually enter a discussion
with preconceived thoughts and ideas that prevent me from absorbing new
information or giving it a chance. This also leads to some people thinking that
I'm closed minded.

a few tools that would help me overcome these barriers and open up and better
organize my creative thought processes.
