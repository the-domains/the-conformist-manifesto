WHO AM I?

The
Creativity and Self-Reflection Worksheet has made me realize that my main
creative barriers have to do with procrastination and a disorganized process for creating ideas. While I'm usually open minded, I usually enter a discussion
with preconceived thoughts and ideas and this prevents me from easily assimilating new

I'm closed minded.

a few tools that would help me overcome these barriers and open up and better
organize my creative thought processes.
