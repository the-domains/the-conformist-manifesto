ENTP conformist? How is that possible!?

The ENTP personality types are considered the pioneered entrepreneurs. The type most likely to take our skills and set off on a solo adventure.

Considering we make up only 3% of the population, I think we're in great company!

I definitely need to let loose like RDJ

and speak my mind like FRY. I certainly love debating

and am not afraid to make an ass of myself like Sacha Baron Cohen. Very Nice!

I am also nearly as funny as John Cleese and maybe even more creative than he is! My sense of humour and my uncompromising honesty and humility are clear attributes of an ENTP.

Neil Patrick Harris aka Mr.Awesome himself,

and even Walt Disney!

The only problem ENTP's seem to have is that we aren't very fond of doing the grunt work.

After reading through the various personality types I have discovered that the perfect solution to our problems is to simply keep the company a few ISTJ's so that the actual work gets done!
